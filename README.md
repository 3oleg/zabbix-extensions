zabbix-extensions
=================

Zabbix additional monitoring extensions:

- written in Bash (doesn't requires dependencies*);
- extensions tested, but proper work isn't guaranteed (when a mismatch between software version);

* except utilities for working directly with the applications (redis-cli, hpacucli, psql, etc...).
